## üêõ Known Issues & Risks

### Current Issues
- **None yet** - Project just starting

### Anticipated Risks
1. **LLM Code Quality**: Generated code may not be immediately useful
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive prompt engineering and validation
   
2. **API Rate Limits**: CoinGecko and GitHub API constraints
   - **Mitigation**: Proper rate limiting and retry logic
   
3. **Code Safety**: Generated code could be harmful
   - **Mitigation**: Sandboxed execution and human review

4. **System Stability**: 24/7 operation challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling and logging

### Technical Debt Concerns
- **JSON Storage Scalability**: May need database eventually
- **Single-threaded Design**: Could become bottleneck
- **Manual Testing**: Need automated testing framework
