# Active Context: Current Work & Immediate Focus

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation & Memory Bank Initialization** (Week 1)
- **Status**: In Progress - Creating memory bank structure
- **Focus**: Setting up foundational documentation and project structure
- **Timeline**: Just started, completing initial setup

## ðŸ”„ Recent Changes

### Just Completed
1. **Memory Bank Initialization** âœ…
   - Created `.cursor/memory-bank/` directory structure
   - Established core documentation files:
     - `projectbrief.md` - Project foundation and scope
     - `productContext.md` - User experience and value proposition
     - `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture patterns
     - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and constraints

### Currently Working On
2. **Memory Bank Foundation** âœ… COMPLETED
   - All core documentation files created and populated
   - Progress tracking framework established
   - Basic project structure implemented

### Just Completed  
3. **Phase 1 Foundation Implementation** âœ…
   - Basic project structure created (directories, files)
   - Core prediction logic implemented and tested
   - Configuration management and logging setup
   - README.md with comprehensive documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architectural Decisions Made
- **MVP-First Approach**: Focus only on core functionality
- **JSON Storage**: Simple file-based persistence for MVP
- **Manual PR Review**: Human approval required for safety
- **24-Hour Cycles**: Fixed evaluation timing to keep simple
- **Single Repository**: All code in one GitHub repo

### Technology Choices Confirmed
- **Python 3.9+** as main language
- **LangChain** for agent orchestration
- **OpenAI GPT-4** as primary LLM (with Claude backup)
- **CoinGecko API** for Bitcoin price data
- **PyGithub** for automated PR creation

### Current Implementation Strategy
- **Week 1**: Project foundation + basic prediction logic
- **Week 2**: LangChain agent setup + evaluation
- **Week 3**: Code improvement with LLM
- **Week 4**: GitHub PR automation
- **Week 5**: End-to-end testing

## ðŸš§ Current Blockers & Challenges

### None Currently
- Project just started, no blockers yet
- All dependencies and APIs identified
- Clear path forward established

### Anticipated Challenges
1. **LLM Code Generation Quality**: Ensuring generated code is actually useful
2. **GitHub API Integration**: Handling authentication and rate limits
3. **Error Handling**: Making system robust for continuous operation
4. **Code Safety**: Validating generated code before execution

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Work Queue

### Next 3 Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Complete `progress.md`** - Track implementation phases and status
2. **Create Basic Project Structure** - Set up directories and foundational files
3. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation** - Start with basic prediction logic

### This Week's Goals
- [x] Complete memory bank documentation foundation âœ…
- [x] Set up basic Python project structure âœ…
- [x] Create initial `predictor.py` with simple keyword logic âœ…
- [x] Add JSON logging for predictions âœ…
- [x] Test basic prediction functionality locally âœ…

### Next Week's Goals (Phase 2)
- [ ] Implement CoinGecko price fetching tool
- [ ] Create LangChain Evaluator chain
- [ ] Add APScheduler for 24h evaluation cycles
- [ ] Test evaluation logic with sample predictions

## ðŸ”„ Context for Future Sessions

### What's Working
- Clear project vision and scope defined
- Technical architecture patterns established
- Development approach and timeline planned
- Memory bank foundation created

### Key Context to Remember
- This is a **proof-of-concept** for autonomous AI self-improvement
- **Bitcoin prediction** is just the demonstration domain
- **GitHub PRs** are the key mechanism for showing self-improvement
- **Simplicity** is prioritized over sophistication for MVP

### Important Constraints
- **No complex databases** - keep it simple with JSON
- **No web interfaces** - command line operation only
- **Manual PR merging** - safety over automation
- **Local operation** - no cloud deployment for MVP

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics to Track

### Short-term (This Week)
- [ ] Memory bank fully documented
- [ ] Basic project structure created
- [ ] Simple prediction logic working
- [ ] JSON logging implemented

### Medium-term (Phase 1-2)
- [ ] LangChain agent orchestration working
- [ ] CoinGecko integration functional
- [ ] Evaluation logic operational
- [ ] 24-hour scheduling implemented

### Long-term (End of 5 Weeks)
- [ ] First autonomous PR created by agent
- [ ] Code improvement actually works
- [ ] System operates continuously for 1+ week
- [ ] Demonstrable self-improvement observable

## ðŸ’¡ Learning & Insights

### New Understanding
- Memory bank pattern provides excellent foundation for project context
- Clear separation between product vision and technical implementation helps
- 5-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with MVP scope

### Decisions That May Need Revisiting
- **JSON vs SQLite**: May need database if prediction volume grows
- **24-hour cycles**: Might need more frequent evaluation for faster iteration  
- **Single LLM provider**: May want multiple providers for robustness

### Areas for Future Exploration
- More sophisticated Bitcoin prediction models (post-MVP)
- Real-time data streaming (post-MVP)
- Automated testing of generated code (near-term improvement)
- Multi-asset prediction support (future version)
