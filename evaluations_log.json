This represents a complete misalignment between the prediction and the actual market behavior. Given the extreme volatility and the substantial price increase, the prediction was not only incorrect but also failed to account for the prevailing market conditions that favored upward momentum. Therefore, the confidence score is set to 0.0, reflecting the total inaccuracy of the prediction.",
